# Introduction-To-NS3-Simulator
The main objective of this work is to provide practical works as examples to learn about the use of the widespread network simulator, which is NS3.

The work consists of 7 simulations as follows:

1 / The first simulation, named Simulation 1, allows to establish a communication between a client and a server via Socket.

2 / The second simulation, named Simulation 2, establishes a client / server architecture composed of two clients and a single server. One of the clients is connected to the server in Peer to Peer. As for the second client, he is linked to the CSMA server.

3 / The third simulation, called Simulation 3, establishes a client / server architecture consisting of two clients and a single server that is at the same time an access point. Indeed, one of the clients is connected to the server in Peer to Peer. As for the second client, he is linked to the server by WiFi, he will consider the server as his access point.

4 / The fourth simulation, called Simulation 4, establishes a client / server architecture composed of two clients and a single server. One of the clients is connected to the server in Peer to Peer. As for the second client, it forms with the server an Adhoc network.

5 / The simulated simulation, named Simulation 5, establishes a client / server architecture composed of two clients and a single server. Both clients are connected to the CSMA / CD server. The specification of this topology is that it realizes a simple protocol of communication and exchange of information by diffusion of messages.

6 / The sixth simulation, named Simulation 6, establishes a client / server architecture composed of two clients and a single server. Both clients are connected to the server in Peer to Peer. The specification of this topology is that the server performs a sum computation of two integers sent by its clients. He will then send the sum calculated to his two customers via a broadcast message. The Code was been tested with the NS 3.40 Version.

7 / The latest simulation, called Simulation 7 Composite, is a client / server architecture with 5 clients and a single server that also serves as an access point for one of its clients.
The links between the clients and the servers are WiFi, Peer to Peer, CSMA, and Adhoc links.

SimulationX : Many others .cc files are added as examples.
